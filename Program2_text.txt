Our class computer is a small classical CISC computer.This does not match any real.Rather it is a contrived example to get you to think about how to execute certain kinds of instructions.In doing so it will make you think about the macro-structure of the CPU for example what the programmer sees and the micro-structure and those components the programmer does not see.Note that some of the components the programmer might be able to see are not accessible by instructions.Instructions are aligned on a word boundary.
